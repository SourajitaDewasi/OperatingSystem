# OperatingSystem
Algorithms Studied During Operating Sytem Course
1. First In First Out (FIFO)
2. Least Recently Used (LRU)
3. Most Recently Used (MRU)
4. Optimal
## Allocation
1. Indexed Allocation
2. Linked Allocation: Linked Allocation is a non-contiguous memory allocation method. We just keep a link of the next 
address in the previous block to not search throught memory for faster allocation or deallocation
